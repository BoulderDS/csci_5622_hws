This is an example of a custom feature transformer. The constructor is used
to store the state (e.g like if you need to store certain words/vocab), the
fit method is used to update the state based on the training data, and the
transform method is used to transform the data into the new feature(s). In
this example, we simply use the length of the movie review as a feature. This
requires no state, so the constructor and fit method do nothing.
